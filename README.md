This is a Codecademy Project with the following objective
=========================================================

BUILD A WEBSITE WITH HTML, CSS, AND GITHUB PAGES
------------------------------------------------


Off-Platform Project: Excursion
................................


In this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called “Excursion.” 

This gets us to use our growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. 

It is coming together!

The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. 

A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.

We are working  with Git and GitHub on our local machines, where we used the articles on the Command Line Interface Setup and Git Setup.
